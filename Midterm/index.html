            <p>Do you have what it takes to become Apex Champions?</p>

            <p>In Apex teams containing  of 3 members shows off their legendary skills in combat against enemy players to win the game. The goal of the game is to collect wepaons, armor, and other supporting attachments to beat all other teams and come out as the last team standing. A few things to worry about is that as the match lengthens there is a ring that closes in around the players pushing everyone survives into one point on the map. Players standing in the ring will slowly take damage as each circle of the map comes to a close. This pushes players to continue on and even casuses more battles to be had to keep enemy teams outside of the safe zone. So when looking around for gear always be keeping an eye out for an enemy team and for the ring closing in. A key element to this game is to always keep moving slowing down might just be what keeps you and your team from winning.</p>
