            <p>Getting ready to play?</p>

            <p>Here we have some screenshots from the game. First we have a look at the shop that has special skins avaliable for characters, weapons, and even charms for your guns! There is even special herilooms for sale that some charcters that they bring into the ring with them. Next we have a look of the in-game lobby. There is 2 slots for you to invite other players so that you can take on game as a group and show each other the items you have for you characters. After that we have the view of what it looks like playing the game. This player is inside the ring and is starting to take damage but still has a chance to make it out. Lastly, we have a picture of the legend Wraith looking at a portal in the sky. On some maps there are portals around that can put you in a different area on the map. This could either save you from an enemy team or drop you into a new one depending on who is around.</p>
